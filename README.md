# View Remote Images and Download

This package is a simple way of downloading remote images. It is not fool proof but is good to work with when you need to just view images

* Supply all the images into the `_data/images.json` file. There are ofcourse otherways to import data. In my case, I have used the 11ty's standard method [https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global/](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global/). The template `index.md` is also configured to suit the data file.

## Uses
* [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)
